# Red-Black-Trees-Iteration
Modify the red-black tree implementation from the textbook:

https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/RedBlackBST.java.html (Links to an external site.)

so that the put() and delete() methods use iteration rather than recursion. One way to do this is to use an explicit stack (although there are other ways). You do not need to change deleteMin() or deleteMax().

Show your code, and show a trace of each of the methods on a particular tree.
